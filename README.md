# Forensic Ethics & Methodologies

## Description
This project explores digital forensics concepts, methodologies, and ethical considerations. Through a series of practical exercises and scenarios, you will learn about forensic analysis techniques, evidence handling, and investigative approaches to cybersecurity incidents.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you will be able to:
- Understand digital forensics fundamentals
- Apply ethical principles in forensic investigations
- Extract and analyze metadata from digital evidence
- Identify common attack vectors and vulnerabilities
- Assess the impact of security breaches

## Project Tasks
- **Task 0**: The Case of the Mysterious Image - Analyzing image metadata
- **Task 1**: Unraveling Location Clues from Image Metadata - Geolocation forensics
- **Task 2**: Deciphering the Intruder's Intent - Analyzing network intrusion scenarios
